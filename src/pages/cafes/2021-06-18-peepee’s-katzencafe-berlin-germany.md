PeePee’s is tricky to find, down a residential street in Neukölln, with just a christmas tree outside to mark it. It’s run by a lovely lady with pink hair who makes all her own clothes, and is home to 2 cats; brothers Pelle and Caruso, who are often up for cuddles! If it’s the right time of year, the Flammkuchens (German pizza-like food with a dough base topped with cream, onions, and bacon) here are fantastic - they’re freshly made to order and are very filling. At PeePee’s it’s clear that it’s a place for cat lovers; everything down to the spoon you stir your hot chocolate with is a cat! There are paintings, tapestries, and whatever other media visitors leave portraits of the cats in, displayed on the walls.
