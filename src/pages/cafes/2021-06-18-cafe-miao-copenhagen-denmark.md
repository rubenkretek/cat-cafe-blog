Cafe Miao was our first ever experience of a cat cafe, we were very excited to see two of our favourite things - cats and coffee - combined. Cafe Miao is located on a fairly quiet street, but no more than a 10 minute walk away from the town centre where most other attractions can be found. When we entered the cafe, we were met by a lady wearing cat ears and a cute apron who took our order. Our first opinion of Cafe Miao was that it seemed more like a school canteen than a cafe, but we soon felt more at home when we spotted various cats curled up around the edges of the room. The cafe has a fairly large selection of cats, who all seemed very happy, and who had an area out of the public eye where they could take themselves off to if they needed an escape route. It’s quite an expensive cafe, though most in Denmark are anyway, but there’s no time limit to how long you can spend in there. The food and drink that we sampled were great and cat-themed, cute cat cupcakes and cat faces in the froth of the coffee! There are also cat-related games and books on the shelves which guests are welcome to explore (we didn’t have time to play Catopoly so we later found it online and bought it for ourselves - it’s a brilliant adaptation of Monopoly!), as well as lots of cat toys to try and rouse a feline friend with.
