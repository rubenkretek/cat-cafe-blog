Romeow is another cat café that’s rather difficult to locate, as it’s in quite an obscure part of the outskirts of Rome. It’s a very modern cat café, with Scandinavian-style designs inside and a sleek finish. Unfortunately for us, the café only serves vegan food and drinks (though that’s obviously an up-side for a lot of people!).
