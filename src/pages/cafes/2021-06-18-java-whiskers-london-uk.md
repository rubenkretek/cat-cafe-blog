[Java Whiskers](https://javawhiskers.co.uk/) is the second cat café to open in London, and doesn't disappoint. The café is small and cozy, with a fake fireplace and lots of high up cat-accessible routes around the café. Everyone removes their shoes before entering, which works well as not only does it protect the cats from outside nasties, it also makes sitting on the floor to play with the cats more appealing!

It's one of the more expensive cafés we've visited, at £15 a head for a 55 minute visit, and food and drinks on top - the coffee was delicious and they do offer milk alternatives.

This café uses the adoption model, so almost all of the cats in the café are up for rescue - the café works in partnership with [The Scratching Post](http://www.scratchingpost.co.uk/) cat rescue, who provide them with cats who would suit the cat café environment. Though the café hasn't been open long, they've already managed to adopt out 15+ cats.

In terms of accessibility, the café has wide doorways and an accessible loo, but is rather small inside, so a wheelchair visit would probably need to be arranged with the café in advance. At the moment, the information about the cats is given by the host verbally, so visitors with hearing difficulties may struggle - though said information can also be found on their website.
